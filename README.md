## üîß Configuration

### API Endpoints
- **CSKB API**: `http://localhost:8000`
  - `/health` - Health check
  - `/ingest/pdf` - PDF ingestion
  - `/query` - Knowledge base querying
  - `/documents` - Document listing

- **Feedback API**: `http://localhost:8002`
  - `/health` - Health check
  - `/feedback` - Feedback submission
  - `/enhanced-kb/populate` - Enhanced KB population

### Test Parameters
- **PDF Path**: `../../pdf-files/technical_troubleshooting_guide.pdf`
- **Issue Description**: Network connectivity problems after system updates
- **Document Category**: Technical Support
- **Ticket Priority**: Medium

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Primary Scenario: Complete Knowledge Base Enhancement
This scenario validates the end-to-end workflow where:
1. Initial knowledge base provides AI-generated responses
2. Human agents review and provide feedback
3. Feedback is stored and used to enhance the knowledge base
4. Enhanced knowledge base improves future AI responses

### Test Validation Points
- **API Connectivity** - Both services are accessible and healthy
- **Document Processing** - PDFs are successfully ingested and processed
- **AI Response Quality** - RAG-based responses are generated with source documents
- **Feedback Integration** - Human feedback is properly captured and stored
- **Enhanced KB Population** - Feedback successfully populates the enhanced knowledge base

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Response Time Tracking
- **API Health Check**: ~26ms
- **PDF Ingestion**: ~86ms
- **AI Response Generation**: ~6-8 seconds
- **Feedback Submission**: ~42ms
- **Enhanced KB Population**: ~5-6 seconds

### Success Criteria
- **100% Step Success Rate** - All 7 workflow steps must complete successfully
- **Total Execution Time**: Typically 15-20 seconds
- **Data Integrity** - All generated IDs and responses must be valid
- **Report Generation** - Comprehensive markdown report must be created

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Connection Failed**
   - Verify both services are running
   - Check ports 8000 and 8002
   - Ensure firewall settings allow local connections

2. **PDF File Not Found**
   - Verify PDF path: `../../pdf-files/technical_troubleshooting_guide.pdf`
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure PDF file exists and is readable

3. **Enhanced KB Population Failed**
   - Verify Feedback API is accessible
   - Check API endpoint `/enhanced-kb/populate`
   - Review request payload structure

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by modifying the logging level:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

- **Retry Logic** - Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Multiple Document Types** - Support for various file formats
- **Performance Benchmarking** - SLA monitoring and alerting
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end validation with real data
