## System Overview

The system consists of three main components:

- **RAG API** (Port 8000): Handles PDF ingestion and AI-powered knowledge queries
- **Ticketing API** (Port 8001): Manages customer support tickets
- **React UI** (Port 3000/3001): User interface for both systems

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.12+** installed
2. **Node.js 18+** installed
3. **OpenAI API Key** in `.env` file
4. **All dependencies** installed

### Environment Setup

```bash

## Testing the React UI

### 1. Open the Application

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### 2. Test PDF Upload

1. Go to the "PDF Upload" tab
2. Click "Choose File" or drag a PDF
3. Enter document name and category
4. Click "Upload PDF"
5. Verify success message

### 3. Test Knowledge Query

1. Go to the "Knowledge Query" tab
2. Enter a query like "How do I reset my password?"
3. Click "Query Knowledge"
4. Verify response with sources

### 4. Test Ticketing System

1. Go to the "Ticketing System" tab
2. View existing tickets
3. Create a new ticket
4. Test AI resolution on a ticket

### 5. Test AI Resolution

1. Click the ðŸ¤– AI icon next to any ticket
2. Wait for AI response
3. Verify the response includes:
   - AI-generated solution
   - Source documents
   - Proper formatting

## End-to-End Testing

### Complete Workflow Test

1. **Upload a PDF** via the React UI
2. **Query the knowledge base** with a relevant question
3. **Create a support ticket** with the same issue
4. **Use AI resolution** on the ticket
5. **Verify consistency** between knowledge query and AI resolution

### Expected Results

- âœ… PDF uploads successfully
- âœ… Knowledge queries return relevant responses
- âœ… AI resolution provides helpful solutions
- âœ… Sources are properly attributed
- âœ… Different queries return different document chunks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. CORS Errors

**Symptoms:** Browser console shows CORS policy errors

**Solution:** Ensure CORS middleware is properly configured in `cskb-api/main.py`

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

#### 2. Vector Search Failures

**Symptoms:** Logs show "Vector search failed" messages

**Solution:** The system automatically falls back to semantic search, but check:
- LanceDB installation
- OpenAI API key configuration
- Database permissions

#### 3. Port Conflicts

**Symptoms:** "Address already in use" errors

**Solution:** Kill existing processes or use different ports

```bash
# Find processes using ports
lsof -i :8000 -i :8001 -i :3000

# Kill specific process
kill <PID>
```

#### 4. React Build Errors

**Symptoms:** TypeScript compilation errors

**Solution:** 
```bash
cd cskb-react-ui
npm run build
```

Check for specific error messages and fix accordingly.

### Debug Commands

#### Check Service Status

```bash
# Check RAG API
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health

# Check Ticketing API
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/health

# Check React UI (if running)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000
```

#### Check Logs

```bash
# RAG API logs (in terminal where it's running)
# Look for: INFO, DEBUG, ERROR messages

# Ticketing API logs (in terminal where it's running)
# Look for: Database operations, API requests

# React UI logs (in browser console)
# Look for: Network requests, JavaScript errors
```

#### Verify Data

```bash
# Check documents in knowledge base
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/documents

# Check tickets in system
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/tickets

# Check specific ticket
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/tickets/1
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

Test with multiple concurrent requests:

```bash
# Test multiple queries simultaneously
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"query\": \"Test query $i\"}" &
done
wait
```

### Response Time Testing

Measure response times:

```bash
# Test response time
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How do I reset my password?"}'
```

## Success Criteria

A successful test run should demonstrate:

1. âœ… **All services start** without errors
2. âœ… **PDF ingestion works** and documents are stored
3. âœ… **Knowledge queries return** relevant responses
4. âœ… **AI resolution provides** helpful solutions
5. âœ… **Different queries retrieve** different document chunks
6. âœ… **Ticketing system** creates and manages tickets
7. âœ… **React UI** displays all components correctly
8. âœ… **End-to-end workflow** functions smoothly

## Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Deploy to production** environment
2. **Set up monitoring** and logging
3. **Configure backup** and recovery procedures
4. **Train support staff** on the new system
5. **Gather user feedback** and iterate
